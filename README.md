# To Do List
A demo Android app for those getting started with Android development!

# Project location
All of the relevant project files are located under <b>app/src/main</b>

# Important folders and files
The <b>AndroidManifest.xml</b> file is where you would list all of the different activities (screens) for your app. You can also specify various permissions and general app attributes within this file.

The <b>java/com/thevarunshah/todolist</b> folder contains your Java classes. This is where you design the backend of your project. All of your Activity classes also go here (they are the ones which end with '...View') - these classes are where you would manipulate your various screens. 

The <b>res</b> folder contains all of the resources used in your app. The <b>drawable</b> and <b>minimap</b> folders contain image resources. The <b>layout</b> folder contains the layouts for your screens (activities). The <b>values</b> folder contains modifications to your app along with global settings such as themes (styles), colors, and strings.

# Components
The various components, structure, and methods are commented in detail in the Java files.
